# Platform-Automation
Dept. of VA, Platform Automation created by Digital Transformation Center automation engineers.

What the project does
This project contains a Provar Workspace and an Eggplant Suite that is used to demonstrate Robotic Process Automation practices in both tools.

Why the project is useful
This project demonstrates how automation using these tools can take over repetitive, predictable tasks from valuable human resources.

How users can get started with the project
Users must acquire licensing for Provar and or Eggplant to use this project. Further, they will have to customize their access credentials and source URLs to use the project as-is. Most likely, users will download this project to scavenge bits of code rather than executing it as-is.
